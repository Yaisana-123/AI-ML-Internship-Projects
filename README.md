# 🤖 AI/ML Internship Projects
(Projects for Codec Technologies AI Internship)

This repository contains two Machine Learning projects developed during my **AI/ML Internship** at Codec Technologies.

## 📌 Projects

### 1️⃣ Handwritten Digit Recognizer 🖊️
- Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using the MNIST dataset
- Recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) from images
- Trained and tested using TensorFlow/Keras
- **Key Skills:** CNN, Image Processing, Deep Learning

➡️ **Notebook:** `Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer.ipynb`

### 2️⃣ Twitter Sentiment Analysis 🐦
- Developed a **Sentiment Analysis Tool** to classify tweets as:
  - ✅ Positive
  - ❌ Negative
  - ⚪ Neutral
- Used **NLTK** for preprocessing and **Naive Bayes Classifier** for prediction
- Implemented TF-IDF Vectorizer for feature extraction
- **Key Skills:** NLP, Text Classification, Machine Learning

➡️ **Notebook:** `Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`
